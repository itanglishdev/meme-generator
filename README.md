# meme creator

This project is an exercise SPA from scrimba. Used an API to collect the images for the memes and then created two text boxes that allowed me to add some text to the meme images. It obviously didn't always align with the meme picture, but still felt like a nice little side project.

## Creation

Used create-react-app instead of following along on the scrimba page and made my own repo and SPA



**Note: this is not a project idea I came up with**
